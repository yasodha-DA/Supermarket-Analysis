# Supermarket-Analysis
Supermarket analysis uses transactional data to uncover customer trends, product performance, and financial insights across store locations.
In this supermarket analysis project, I utilized a combination of Excel, Power Query, and Power BI to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights. 
Excel was used for initial data cleaning, formula-based calculations, and validating financial metrics such as tax and profit income. 
Power Query streamlined the data transformation processâ€”converting date and time formats, categorizing fields, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Power BI enabled the creation of interactive dashboards, where I applied DAX to build custom measures like profit margin, monthly sales, and rating averages. 
Through dynamic visuals, slicers, and conditional formatting, I delivered a clear, user-friendly interface that highlights customer behavior, product performance, and branch-level trends.
